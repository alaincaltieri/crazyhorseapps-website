The following Terms of Use and End User License Agreement (“EULA”) constitute an agreement between you (“You”) and A. Caltieri Apps di Alain Caltieri (“Service Provider”), governing the use of the software applications downloaded through the Apple App Store (the “Licensed Application(s)”). For questions, complaints or claims with respect to the Licensed Application, please contact [help.chapps@gmail.com](mailto:help.chapps@gmail.com).

You acknowledge and accept that (i) the previsions of this EULA shall not be deemed to set an agreement between You and Apple (or its subsidiaries) in any manner whatsoever and (ii) Apple and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this EULA, therefore Apple and its subsidiaries shall have the right and are deemed to have accepted the right to enforce this EULA against You as a third party beneficiary thereof.

Please consider that the Licensed Application are licensed, not sold, to You for use only under the terms of this EULA, unless the same are accompanied by a different license agreement, in which case the terms of that different license agreement will govern the relationship between You and the Service Provider, subject to Your prior acceptance of that separate license agreement. The Service Provider reserves all rights not expressly granted to You hereinafter.

#### Scope

According to this EULA, the Service Provider grants you with a non-transferable license to use for personal and non-commercial use the Licensed Application on any Apple iOS device that You own or control and in accordance with all applicable laws and Apple’s Usage Rules. This license does not allow You to use the Licensed Application on any Apple iOS device that You do not own or control.

You may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time, except that such Licensed Application may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with You via Apple Family Sharing.

You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license and Apple’s Usage Rules), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the Licensed Application). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of the Service Provider and its licensors, if any. If You breach this restriction, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by Service Provider that replace and/or supplement the Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license shall prevail over this EULA.

You acknowledge and accept to comply with applicable third party terms of agreement related to the use of the Licensed Application.

#### Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.

#### Ownership

The Service Provider and/or its licensor retain all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Application, the Services and any content of the same, including, but not limited to, all copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, trade names, proprietary rights, patents, titles, computer codes, audiovisual effects, themes, characters, characters names, stories, dialog, settings, artwork, sound effects, musical works, and moral rights whether registered or not and all applications thereof. You hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership in the Licensed Application, the Services and any content of the same is being transferred or assigned hereby and this EULA is not to be construed as a sale of any rights in the same.

#### Termination

This EULA shall commence on the date that you accept the same expressly or install or otherwise use the Licensed Application and shall end on the date of your disposal of the Licensed Application, save for earlier termination in accordance with this agreement. It is understood that the validity of this EULA and the validity of any purchase associated to the Licensed Application shall be construed independently from each other, this meaning that (i) the termination of such associated purchase shall not affect the validity of this EULA and (ii) the termination of this EULA shall not affect the validity of such associated purchase.

Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the Service Provider if You attempt to circumvent any technical protection measures used in connection with the Licensed Application and/or Services or you otherwise use the Licensed Application and/or Services in breach of the terms of this EULA. Upon termination of the license, You shall cease all use of the Licensed Application, and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Licensed Application.

You agree that Service Provider may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about Your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to You (if any) related to the Licensed Application.

All data treated by the Service Provider shall be in compliance with EU Reg n. 679/2016, Italian privacy laws and Service Provider’s privacy policy, as linked on the Licensed Application’s App Store page.

#### Services and Third Party Materials

The Licensed Application may enable access to Service Provider’s and third party services and web sites (collectively and individually, "Services"). Use of the Licensed Application and/or the Services may require Internet access and/or third party Services. In any case, the cost related to Internet access and third party Services - as well as any liability related to the above - shall be borne exclusively by You.

No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and You shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that the Service Provider is not in any way responsible for any such use by You, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive or illegal messages or transmissions that You may receive as a result of using any of the Services.

In addition, third party Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed from, displayed on or linked to from your Apple iOS device are not available in all languages or in all countries.

To the extent You choose to access such Services or Materials, You do so at Your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws. The Service Provider, and its licensors, reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice.

To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall Service Provider be liable for any third party claim arising from your non-compliance with this EULA and/or any applicable law. You hereby undertake to indemnify and hold Service Provider harmless from any damage, loss, cost, fee borne by the same in relation to your non-compliance with this EULA and/or any third party claim in relation to Your use of Licensed Application and/or the Service (including the content that you publish or display).
