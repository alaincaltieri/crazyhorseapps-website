Welcome and thank you for your interest in my apps. You can also check support pages for my [**UpRead**]({{ "support/faq-upread/" | relative_url}}) or [**Diary**]({{ "support/diary-faq/" | relative_url}}) apps.


Here are some common questions to all my apps.

##### ![fa-crown](/images/fa-icons/money.svg) How can I manage my subscription?

Open the App Store app, tap your profile image and select "Suscriptions". You can also use [this link](https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions) to access that page.

If the app doesn't appear there, you're not subscribed to it!

If you made a purchase by mistake, please see the [official Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039#subscriptions) to ask for a refund.

##### ![fa-crown](/images/fa-icons/clock.svg) Can I purchase the app forever?

You can purchase most of my apps forever. To do that, go tho the settings section, then "Manage my subscription" and follow the instructions.


##### ![fa-crown](/images/fa-icons/lightbulb.svg) I have a feature idea...
