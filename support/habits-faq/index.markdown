Welcome!  
First of all, thank you for using the app. I've collected here a few frequent questions about the app that may help you. Here we go!

##### ![fa-crown](/images/fa-icons/sync.svg) Can I sync habits with all my devices

Yes it is! You need to enable syncing from the app (More > Backup, sync and export) and you must have a valid iCloud account with enough spare space available. 

If you are having issues with syncing, here's a list of useful actions you can take:
1. Make sure you're using the latest app version, get it [from the App Store](https://apple.co/3PqueKO)
2. Are you logged into iCloud? Check from settings
3. Do you have enough iCloud free space? Make sure to have some by either removing unused data or purchasing a bigger iCloud plan from Apple.
4. Ensure syncing is enabled in the app (menu > Backup, sync and export)
5. Please do the same on every device that needs to sync, making sure all of them are logged to the same iCloud account.
6. Does the app report a sync error? You can see this insite the app (menu > Backup, sync and export). If so, please let me know the error code!

## Some common questions to all my apps

##### ![fa-crown](/images/fa-icons/money.svg) How can I manage my subscription?

Open the App Store app, tap your profile image and select "Suscriptions". You can also use [this link](https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions) to access that page.

If the app doesn't appear there, you're not subscribed to it!

If you made a purchase by mistake, please see the [official Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039#subscriptions) to ask for a refund.

##### ![fa-crown](/images/fa-icons/clock.svg) Can I purchase the app forever?

You can purchase most of my apps forever. To do that, go tho the settings section, then "Manage my subscription" and follow the instructions.
