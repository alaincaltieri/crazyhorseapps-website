## UpRead - Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome!  
First of all, thank you for using the app. I've collected here a few frequent questions about the app that may help you. Here we go!

#####

I have trouble importing content






The best place to start is the _[import troubleshooting page](https://desk.zoho.com/portal/crazyhorseapps/en/kb/articles/blast-import-troubleshooting)_. There you can find solutions for common issues and a form to report bugs.




#####

How does UpRead work?






We use a technique called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation that allows anybody to read faster with little or no training. For more info, have a look at the [_scientific research_](https://crazyhorseapps.com/apps/upread/upread-scientific-research/) we based UpRead on.




#####

Are ebooks supported?






UpRead supports any .txt and .pdf file as long as they contain digital text (not images of text).

If you your book has a different file format, I recommend using [_Calibre_](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to convert it. It's free :)  
Please note that UpRead may have a hard time processing very big files. You may want to break up your book in chapters before importing. That's a known limitation I hope to get fixed in a future release.

## Some common questions to all my apps

#####

How can I manage my subscription?






Open the App Store app, tap your profile image and select "Suscriptions". You can also use [this link](https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions) to access that page.

If the app doesn't appear there, you're not subscribed to it!

If you made a purchase by mistake, please see the [official Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039#subscriptions) to ask for a refund.

#####

Can I purchase the app forever?






You can purchase most of my apps forever. To do that, go tho the settings section, then "Manage my subscription" and follow the instructions.
