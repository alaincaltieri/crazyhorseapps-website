## Diary - Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome!  
First of all, thank you for using the app. I've collected here a few frequent questions about the app that may help you. Here we go!

#####

Can I sync content with all my devices






It is not possible to sync content between devices. I'm already aware that this is a feature a lot of users would like to have and I'll do my best to add it to the app in the next release.




#####

Can I print my journal?






This is another very popular feature request that I'll try to add to the app as soon as possible.




#####

I lost my password, how do I access the journal?






There are 2 possible solutions:

If you don't care about **losing your data**, just delete the app from your device and download it again from the App Store ([here's the link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id1447344390)). If the payment screen appears, tap "Restore purchases" to restore your subscription or purchase.

If you want to keep the data, please [send me an email](mailto:help.chapps@gmail.com) and I'll help you unlock the app. Please allow me a few days to answer your request.

## Some common questions to all my apps

#####

How can I manage my subscription?






Open the App Store app, tap your profile image and select "Suscriptions". You can also use [this link](https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions) to access that page.

If the app doesn't appear there, you're not subscribed to it!

If you made a purchase by mistake, please see the [official Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039#subscriptions) to ask for a refund.

#####

Can I purchase the app forever?






You can purchase most of my apps forever. To do that, go tho the settings section, then "Manage my subscription" and follow the instructions.




#####

I love that! I really appreciate your **feedback**, your **ideas** and your **bug reports**. They help me create better apps :)
