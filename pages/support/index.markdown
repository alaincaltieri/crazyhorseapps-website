## Some common questions to all my apps

		
				

##### 
						How can I manage my subscription?					
				


									


						Open the App Store app, tap your profile image and select "Suscriptions". You can also use [this link](https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions) to access that page.  
  
If the app doesn't appear there, you're not subscribed to it! 
  
If you made a purchase by mistake, please see the [official Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039#subscriptions) to ask for a refund.					


				

##### 
						Can I purchase the app forever?					
				


									


						You can purchase most of my apps forever. To do that, go tho the settings section, then "Manage my subscription" and follow the instructions.					


				

##### 
						I have a feature idea...					
				


									


						I love that! I really appreciate your **feedback**, your **ideas** and your **bug reports**. They help me create better apps :)
