Dear users,  
We’ve been working hard to make the app better, more stable and supporting more and more websites with every release. Today we’re adding one of the top features you’ve been requesting: support for multiple words display. Hope you’ll enjoy!  
As usual, feel free to contact us at any time.  
Take care.

Dear users,  
I’m sorry to inform you that the focus point idea has been patented by another company and we’re not allowed to use it. That means we cannot show the red character and the positioning of the word must not be optimised as it previously was.  
We’re looking for alternative strategies that we can add to the app to allow you to read even faster. We’re also exploring collaborations with the company holding the patent to give you an even better product. We’ll take care of keeping you posted about this and any new development on UpRead.  
Thank you for being part of this. As always, please feel free to reach out to us with feedback at [help.chapps@gmail.com](mailto:help.chapps@gmail.com).  
Stay strong and safe.
