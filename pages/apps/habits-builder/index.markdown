Habits are difficult to build or break, but they're incredibly important when it comes to your personal development.







Having some extra help can help a lot in being consistent and motivated. "A simple daily habits tracker" has been designed to do just that!







Add the habits you want to build or break. Add flexible yet powerful reminders. Mark completions on the fly from the widget, the notification or in many ways inside the app. See your current progress and streaks. Get motivated by not breaking the chain and reaching higher and higher levels. But most important than everything else: work on those habits!
