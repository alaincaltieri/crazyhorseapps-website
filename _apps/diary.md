It's really nice to read about ourselves and our lifes sometime in the past. Memories pop up and make us live again the same experiences in a different way.

Being able to remember where we started its very useful in any grow process and it can be very fun too! Our app allows you to keep track of your memories, set questions to answer every day and add pics and moods to every day. This is only the beginning, we're going to add much more!
