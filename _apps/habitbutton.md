A gesture-first habit tracker with an ultra-minimalistic approach.

Habit Button is an habit tracker with a single purpose: make completion instant.
No dashboards. No streak anxiety. No layers to navigate.

Open the app → swipe → done.

Each habit is a tile.
Swipe right to complete.
Swipe left for details.
Nothing else.

It’s built to stay out of your way.
Fast load, clean layout, no decisions to make.

Pure action. Zero overhead.
